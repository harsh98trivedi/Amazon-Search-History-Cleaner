# Privacy Policy for Amazon Search Cleaner

**Last Updated:** September 4, 2025

Thank you for using the Amazon Search Cleaner Chrome Extension. This policy outlines how the extension operates and confirms that your privacy is protected.

### Data Handling and Usage

Amazon Search Cleaner is built with a strong commitment to user privacy. It is designed to be simple, secure, and transparent.

- **No Data Collection:** The extension **does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information (PII)** or any other user data.
- **Local Operation:** All functionality of the extension runs locally within your browser on the active Amazon web page. No information is ever sent to any external server.
- **Website Content Interaction:** The extension interacts with the content of the Amazon page for a single purpose: to focus on the search bar and programmatically click the "delete" buttons on search suggestions. This interaction is temporary and only occurs when you invoke the extension.

### Permissions Justification

The extension requires a minimal set of permissions to perform its function:

- `scripting`: This permission is necessary to execute the code that clears the search suggestions on the active page.
- `activeTab`: This permission grants the extension temporary access to the current tab when the user clicks the icon. It ensures the extension only runs when and where you intend, without needing broad browsing access.
- `host_permissions`: This allows the extension to run on various Amazon domains (e.g., `amazon.com`, `amazon.in`, etc.), ensuring it works regardless of your regional Amazon site.

### Summary

The Amazon Search Cleaner is a tool designed solely to enhance your user experience on Amazon by clearing search suggestions. It does not monitor, collect, or transmit your data.
